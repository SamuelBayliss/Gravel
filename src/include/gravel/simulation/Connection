Plan is, build code which loads in preprocessed 'c' file and open-scop notation and promotes
Polyhedral section to a function call (with appropriate parameters). 

for (x0) {
    for (x1) { 
        S0
        for (x2) {
            S1
        }
    for (x3) {
      S2
      for (x4) {
        S3
      }
    }
    }
}


List all possible merge points

Either point to a statement or a for loop or a bracketed sequence

[0] -> [1] -> (S0 ; ( [2] -> S1 ) ; ( [x3] -> (S2 ; [4] -> S3) ) )
